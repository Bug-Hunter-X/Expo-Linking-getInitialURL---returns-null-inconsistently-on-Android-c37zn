The provided workaround involves using the `addListener` method of the Linking API to listen for URL changes. This approach offers a more robust solution, as it doesn't rely solely on a single `getInitialURL` call which might return `null` due to timing issues. The event listener will handle the URL regardless of the app's initial launch state.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
  if (event.url) {
    // Handle the deep link here
    console.log('Deep link received:', event.url);
  }
});

// ...rest of your component code
```
This approach ensures a more reliable handling of deep links, overcoming the inconsistency encountered with `getInitialURL`.
